# Installation
## IntelliJ IDEA
### Prerequisite
- IntelliJ IDEA Community
- JDK 11 (from Amazon Corretto: OpenJDK)
- JavaFX Library (from Gluon)
### Create a Project
- Project > New > JavaFX > Next > ...
- Make sure to add Global Libraries (for Java 11): File > Project Structure > Global Lib > "+" > Java
- Add those libs to project modules: 
    - File > Project Structure > Right click and "Add to modules..."
    - src > right click and "New" > module-info.java: 
    ```
    requires javafx.fxml;
    requires javafx.controls;
    requires java.xml;
    opens sample;    // this is the package name
    ```
- Run main.java to test.

# JavaFX Overview
- Based on M (Data Model) - V (View - FXML) = C (Controller - middleman for M and V)
- `main.java`: entry point for app. Order of initialize methods : init > start > stop
- In `main.java` file, we can ref to VIEW by using `FXMLLoader.loader( .fxml file)` to load the first .fxml file
- In `.fxml` file, we can ref to MODEL by using `fx:controller="controller_file"` in the parent layout.

# Layouts
JavaFX provides several predefined layouts such as **HBox, VBox, Border Pane, Stack Pane, Text Flow, Anchor Pane, Title Pane, Grid Pane, Flow Panel.**

1. [HBox](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_panes_hbox.htm)
The HBox layout arranges all the nodes in our application in a single horizontal row.

The class named HBox of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the text horizontal box layout.

2. [VBox](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_panes_vbox.htm)
The VBox layout arranges all the nodes in our application in a single vertical column.

The class named VBox of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the text Vertical box layout.

3. [BorderPane](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_borderpane.htm)
The Border Pane layout arranges the nodes in our application in top, left, right, bottom and center positions.

The class named BorderPane of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the border pane layout.

4. [StackPane](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_stackpane.htm)
The stack pane layout arranges the nodes in our application on top of another just like in a stack. The node added first is placed at the bottom of the stack and the next node is placed on top of it.

The class named StackPane of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the stack pane layout.

5. [TextFlow](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_panes_textflow.htm)
The Text Flow layout arranges multiple text nodes in a single flow.

The class named TextFlow of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the text flow layout.

6. [AnchorPane](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_anchorpane.htm)
The Anchor pane layout anchors the nodes in our application at a particular distance from the pane.

The class named AnchorPane of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the Anchor Pane layout.

7. [TilePane](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_tilepane.htm)
The Tile Pane layout adds all the nodes of our application in the form of uniformly sized tiles.

The class named TilePane of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the TilePane layout.

8. [GridPane](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_gridpane.htm)
The Grid Pane layout arranges the nodes in our application as a grid of rows and columns. This layout comes handy while creating forms using JavaFX.

The class named GridPane of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the GridPane layout.

9. [FlowPane](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/layout_flowpane.htm)
The flow pane layout wraps all the nodes in a flow. A horizontal flow pane wraps the elements of the pane at its height, while a vertical flow pane wraps the elements at its width.

The class named FlowPane of the package javafx.scene.layout represents the Flow Pane layout.

## Extra info
1. **HBox/VBox** vs **FlowPane**
Because **FlowPane** will wrap children and try to fit children as many as possible. We can use this layout where children is uncountable. E.g: load from database.
2. Why we use **StackPane**?
Some examples: Text on Image, Image on Border, etc
3. **BorderPane** don't support *alignment*

# Controls
[Link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/javafx_ui_controls.htm)
1. Label
A Label object is a component for placing text.

2. Button
This class creates a labeled button.

3. ColorPicker
A ColorPicker provides a pane of controls designed to allow a user to manipulate and select a color.

4. CheckBox
A CheckBox is a graphical component that can be in either an on(true) or off (false) state.

5. RadioButton
The RadioButton class is a graphical component, which can either be in a ON (true) or OFF (false) state in a group.

6. ListView
A ListView component presents the user with a scrolling list of text items.

7. TextField
A TextField object is a text component that allows for the editing of a single line of text.

8. PasswordField
A PasswordField object is a text component specialized for password entry.

9. Scrollbar
A Scrollbar control represents a scroll bar component in order to enable user to select from range of values.

10. FileChooser
A FileChooser control represents a dialog window from which the user can select a file.

11. ProgressBar
As the task progresses towards completion, the progress bar displays the task's percentage of completion.

12. Slider
A Slider lets the user graphically select a value by sliding a knob within a bounded interval.

## Extra info
1. We can add graphic to Button and Lable by using:
```
<graphic>
    <ImageView>
        <Image url="@/toolbarButtonGraphics/general/TipOfTheDay24.gif"/>
    </ImageView>
</graphic>
```
We can download graphics from [Oracle Java Look&Feel Graphics Repo](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-downloads-java-client-downloads.html#7520-jlf-1.0-oth-JPR)

2. We can group RadioButtons by:
```
<fx:define>
    <ToggleGroup fx:id="colorToggleGroup">
</fx:define>
<RadioButton GridPane.rowIndex="0" GridPane.columnIndex="2" text="Red" toggleGroup="$colorToggleGroup">
<RadioButton GridPane.rowIndex="0" GridPane.columnIndex="3" text="Green" toggleGroup="$colorToggleGroup" selected="true">
<RadioButton GridPane.rowIndex="0" GridPane.columnIndex="4" text="Blue" toggleGroup="$colorToggleGroup">
```
